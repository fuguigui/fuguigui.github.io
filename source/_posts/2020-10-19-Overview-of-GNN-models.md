- [ ] Goal: have a general idea of GNNs
- [ ] Code Goal: implement all the following GNNs using DGL
  - [x] GCN
    - [ ] ChebyNet
  - [ ] MoNet
  - [ ] GraphSage
  - [ ] GAT
  - [ ] GIN
- [ ] Method: Can I decompose the development of their approaches?

The whole project is based on the DGL framework, and follows from its [tutorial](https://docs.dgl.ai/tutorials/models/index.html)
