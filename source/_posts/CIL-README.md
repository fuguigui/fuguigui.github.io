Here are my review notes of course [Computational Intelligence Lab](http://www.da.inf.ethz.ch/teaching/2019/CIL/) opened by ETH Zurich, 2019 Spring.

These notes are my questions/understandings/new findings of related topics, instead of detailed lecture notes. **Not all** knowledge points are covered, which you may refer to the [lecture slides](http://www.da.inf.ethz.ch/teaching/2019/CIL/)/notes/videos or other resources. 

The values of these notes are my questions and thoughts. I believe question is the best teacher.
