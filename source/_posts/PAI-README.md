I took part in the course [Probabilistic Artifical Intelligence](https://las.inf.ethz.ch/pai-f19) in the autumn festival 2019, which is opened by the super star:star2:[Professor Andreas Krause](https://las.inf.ethz.ch/krausea). This serie of notes was created during my review of the course  and contained the main ideas/concepts/methods of each lecture, my own thoughts/ideas/questions as well as out-of-class helpful materials. For more detailed information, please refer to the lecture notes posted on the course homepage.
