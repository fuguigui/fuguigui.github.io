# Basic Knowledge of network

## Questions

- Define the average shortest path length of a network
  - the sum of the shortest path between every two nodes, 
  - divided by the number of pairs 
    - n(n-1) for directed 
    - or n(n-1)/2 for undirected
-  Why does the k-th power of an adjacency matrix count paths of length k?
  - according to the definition of matrix power.
- Can you define the betweenness and closeness centrality of a node.
  - betweenness: the number of shortest path through this node.
    - if normalized, divided the number of shortest paths between node s and t.
  - closeness: the average of the its distance to other nodes. Then, **take the inverse**.
- Can you construct a network in which the node with highest betweenness centrality is the one with the smallest degree centrality?
  - the node between two fully-connected communities.
- Can you explain how we can find the modularity Qopt of a network?
  - searching all the possible community divisions.
- How is Qmax different from Qopt?
  - Qmax is a calculation method working on Q and C, but Qopt is a maximize operation on all possible Q(G,C)
- For a fully connected network with n nodes and no self-loops and a single community C1, can you show that ![img](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?Q%5Cto 0,n%5Cto%5Cinfty)?
  - with a single community, we know that ![img](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?%5Cdelta%28c_i%2Cc_j%29%3D1,Q%28G%2CC%29%3D%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2m%7D%5CSigma_%7Bi%2Cj%7D%28A_%7Bij%7D-%5Cfrac%7Bd_id_j%7D%7B2m%7D%29)
  - the fully connected means ![img](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?d_i%3Dn-1,m%3D%5Cfrac%7Bn%28n-1%29%7D%7B2%7D,A_%7Bij%7D%3D1%5Cforall i%5Cneq j)
  - bring all these values we can get ![img](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?Q%28G%2CC%29%3D1-%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2m%7D%5CSigma_%7Bi%2Cj%7D%5Cfrac%7B%28n-1%29%28n-1%29%7D%7Bn%28n-1%29%7D%3D1-%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bn%28n-1%29%7Dnn%5Cfrac%7B%28n-1%29%7D%7Bn%7D)
  - Here, there may be some different ideas on if ![img](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?%5CSigma_%7Bij%7D) include the diagonal objects, that is whether there are totally n\*n elements or n\*(n-1) elements. This is not a big influence.
- For a network with n nodes, only connected by self-loops (represented by 1-elements on the diagonal) and each node i assigned to its own community Ci , can you show that ![img](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?Q%5Cto %5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D,n%5Cto%5Cinfty)?
	- with its own community, we know that ![img](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?%5Cdelta%28c_i%2Cc_j%29%3D0%5Cforall i%5Cneq j,Q%28G%2CC%29%3D%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2m%7D%5CSigma_%7Bi%7D%28A_%7Bii%7D-%5Cfrac%7Bd_id_i%7D%7B2m%7D%29)
  - only self-loops means ![img](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?d_i%3D2,m%3Dn,A_%7Bii%7D%3D1)
  - bring all these values we can get ![img](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?Q%28G%2CC%29%3D%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2n%7D%5CSigma_%7Bi%7D%281-%5Cfrac%7B4%7D%7B2n%7D%29%3D%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D-%5Cfrac%7B2%7D%7Bn%7D)
  - Note that the degree of each node is 2, not 1.

## Keywords

modularity

# Path

## length of path

![img](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?len%28n_0,n_1,%5Ccdots,n_l%29%3Dl)

### powers of adjacency matrix

elements ![img](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?A_%7Bij%7D%5Ek) counts paths of (exactly) length k between i  and j.

## Distance of two nodes

the shortest length of path between these two nodes.

## Diameter of network

the longest shortest path. 

Use the symbol diam(G)

## Average Shortest path length of network

"the typical shortest path" 

use the symbol \<l\>

## Connected Components

maximally (means locally) connected subgraphs

- size: the number of nodes
- can be shown by the infinite power of adjacency matrix ![img](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?A%5Ek,k%5Cto%5Cinfty)
### largest connected component
the largest subgraph
#### Giant connected component
if the largest connected component contains almost all the nodes
![img](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?%5Cfrac%7B%7CV%27%7C%7D%7B%7CV%7C%7D%5Csimeq 1)



# Community

partitions of nodes, can be overlapping. But we only consider non-overlapping partition.

intuitively, the following two conditions should hold:

- nodes within the same community should be "well-connected" to each other
- nodes in different communities should have few connections.

## Partition Quality: Q

![img](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?Q%28G%2CC%29%3D%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2m%7D%5CSigma_%7Bi%2Cj%7D%28A_%7Bij%7D-%5Cfrac%7Bd_id_j%7D%7B2m%7D%29%5Cdelta%28c_i%2Cc_j%29)

two special cases:

- all nodes in a single community: Q=0
- each community contains only one node: Q=0
- theoretically maximum value 1.

### Qopt

![img](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?Q_%7Bopt%7D%3D%5Cmax_C Q%28G%2CC%29)



the optimal partition quality. This is a property of a given network G. It is called **modularity**

- object: G
- less than 1, due to two reasons:
  - there is a single link (b, d) that connects nodes in different communities
  - there are missing links within both communities (simply because the graph does not have enough links)

### Qmax

![img](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?Q_%7Bmax%7D%28G%2CC%29%3D1-%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2m%7D%5CSigma_%7Bi%2Cj%7D%28%5Cfrac%7Bd_id_j%7D%7B2m%7D%29%5Cdelta%28c_i%2Cc_j%29)





"max" here means a calculation method, guided by some max idea for given G and C, **not** meaning any maximize process.

- object: G and C

### Community assortativity coefficient

the ratio of the Qopt with Qmax got by this optimal C.

- object: G.
- quantify how close the topology is to the strongest possible partitioning, to a range between 0 and 1. This allow us to **judge whether a network exhibits community structure or not**.
