# Faces

## Proposition 1.13

 (i) F is a face of P

(ii) $\exists c\in\mathbb{R}^n$, such that $\delta:=\max\{c^\top x:x\in P\}$ is finite and $F=\{x\in P:c^\top x = \delta\}$

(iii) $F=\{x\in P:\bar{A}x=\bar{b}\}\neq 0$ for a subsystem $\bar{A}x\leq \bar{b}$ of $Ax\leq b$

### Interpretation of position 1.13

(ii): Any face of a polyhedron can be thought as a solution of a linear optimize solution for a particular direction.

(iii) face is always the solution of a subset of constraints taking equations.

These notions are equivalent. 

### Proof of position 1.13

(ii)->(iii). What is the proof plan? We have

$$F:=\{x\in P:c^\top x=\delta\}$$

1. first, understand what (iii) means. It means a subsystem strictly statisfies the equality constraints. Let's reordering these constraints and make the satisfied ones in front of the unsatisfed ones.
   $$
   (\star)a_i^\top x=b_i,\forall x\in F,\forall i\in [k]
   $$
   
2. prove a claim for the other "unsatisfied" constraints. Namely, 

$$
\forall i\in {k+1, \cdots,m}, \exists z\in F, s.t. a_i^\top z<b_i
$$

We want to find a "single" point z, s.t. all of the other constraints are not satisfied.

Apparently, for each "unsatisfied" constraints, we can find a point $z_i$, how to get one $z$ for all of those constraints?

- choose $z=\frac{1}{m-k}\sum_{i=k+1}^m z_i$ (it is called the convex combination of zi)
- to prove that $z\in F$. Because $F=\{x\in\mathbb{R}^n:c^\top x=\delta\}$. $c^\top z = c^\top\frac{1}{m-k}\sum_{i=k+1}^m z_i = \frac{1}{m-k}\sum_{i=k+1}^m c^\top z_i = \frac{1}{m-k}\sum_{i=k+1}^m \delta = \delta$
- to prove $\forall i\in\{k+1,\cdots,m\}, a_i^\top z<b_i$. Replace $z$ by $\frac{1}{m-k}\sum_{i=k+1}^m z_i$, and we have a strict inequality $z_i$ for $i$. Easily to get the argument.

The above proves that $F\subseteq (\star)$

But is the other direction $(\star)\subseteq F$ true? Yes. We gonna prove $\forall x\in (\star)\Rightarrow x\in F$. That also equals to 
$$
\forall x\in P\setminus F, \exist i\in[k], a_i^\top x\neq b_i
$$
The idea is to choose one point $y\in P\setminus F$ and another point $z\in F$. Move z a little bit along the contrary direction of z-y, we can get a contradictory.

Two constraints:

- (*) the all equation constraints, good for convex combination,
- F: the maxmimum value constraints, good for contradictory example.

## Facet-defining inequality

Aim: try to find which inequality is important to define a polyhedron.

For a single one inequation, if we turn it to an equation and get a facet, it is called *facet-defining* inequality.

One facet can be got from different inequalities. Such a property is tightly linked with whether the polyhedron is full-dimensional or not.

For instance,  in ![faces](./pic/20201021faces1.png)

The polyhedron P is not full-dimensional. It has dimension 2 in a 3-dimension space.

The facet drawn by the bold line can be defined by two different inequalities, namely $-4x_1 + x_2+x_3\leq 2$ and $x_1\geq 0$.

But if we only look at the 2-D subspace determined by the red surface, namely $x_1+x_2+x_3 = 2$, the projection of the above two different inequalities become the same, the bold line. In this way, the facet is defined by "only one inequality".

## Proposition 1.17

This proposition makes a link between inequality description and the geometric description, facets.

Proof idea, from proposition 1.13, we know a facet, a particular kind of face, can be defined as $\{x\in P: \bar{A}x=\bar{b}\}$.

Now, we want to show at least one inequality from $\bar{A}x=\bar{b}$ can be turned into equality.

In another direction, we want to pick any of such inequalities $\alpha x=\beta$, turn it into equality, get a space and show such a space is F.

Obviously, such a space contains F, since $\alpha^\top x=\beta \in \bar{A}x=\bar{b}$, Formally,
$$
F = \{x\in P: \bar{A}x=\bar{b}\}\subseteq \{x\in P: \bar{\alpha}^\top x=\bar{\beta}\}\subsetneq P
$$
Also, because 
$$
dim(F)=dim(P)-1\leq dim(\{\bar{A}...\})\leq  dim(\bar{\alpha}...) < dim(P)
$$
All the $\leq$ must be $=$

This proposition implies that if you want to describe a polyhydron by inequality description, you need at least one inequality for each facet.

So facets may be a good measure of how many inequalities you need.

## Extreme point

There is a little difference between a polyhedron and a general convex geometer.

For a polyhedron, an extreme point is a vertex, namely can be the intersection of the polyhedron and a supporting hyperplane.

For a general convex object, a point could be an extreme point, but not a vertex. For instance, the intersection of the supporting hyperplane which contains it may also contain other points.

## Proposition 1.19

A vertex is always an extreme point, but the other direction may not be true.

- Vertex definition: the 0-dimensional facet
- Extreme point: cannot be expressed as the middle of two other points.

Why we care so much about vertex?

Because vertex is closely related to some discrete optimization problem. Vertex is the **unique** solution of some optimization problem.

$y-$tight constraints mean that $y$ can achieve the equality for these constraints. Namely, $\bar{A}y=\bar{b}$.

## Lemma 1.20

The contraposition is that if an inequality is not redundant, it must define a facet.

- [x] what does not redundant mean?

  if it is removed, the optimization objective (polyhedron) changes.

- [x] what does "facet-defining" mean?

  means the dimension of the intersection of the whole space $P$ and this constraints is $dim(P)-1$.




This is not true for non-full-dimensional polyhedron. Can be understood in this way: a non-full dimensional polyhedron need some constraints to "decrease" the dimensions. These constraints are not redundant but also not facet-defining.

## Combination

  Given $x_1,\cdots, x_k\in\mathbb{R}^n$, consider the following combination
$$
  \sum_{i=1}^k \lambda_i x_i
$$

  - if we require $\lambda_i\in\mathbb{R}$, it will be called linear combination

  - if we require $\lambda_i>0$, it will be called conical combination

  - if we require 

    1. $\lambda_i>0$
    2. $\sum_i \lambda_i=1$

    it will be called convex combination.

  - if we require $\sum_i \lambda_i = 1$, it will be called affine combination.

  

## Corollay 1.21

- [x] can two different facet-defining inequalities define a same facet?

  No. Because $P\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$ is full-dimensional, there are $n$ affinely independent points in $F$ . As the hyperplanes $\{x\in\mathbb{R}^n: \alpha^\top_i x = \beta_i\}$ for $i\in[2]:=\{1,2\}$ both contain these n affinely independent points, and must be such that $P\subseteq\{x\in\mathbb{R}^n:\alpha_i^\top x\leq\beta_i\}$, the half-spaces $\{x\in\mathbb{R}^n:\alpha^\top_ix\leq b_i\}$ are the same for $i\in[2]$.



## Degeneracy

- [x] what is the relation between degeneracy and redundant constraints?

  Sometimes, degenerate vertexwill be led by redundant constraints , but it is not always the case. But this could only happen in 3-d or higher. In 2-D, degeneracy always happen with reduntant constraints.

  In other words, we can have degeneracy without any redundance.



## Dominant

The dominant of a point, is that the space you can get by adding non-negative vectors to it.

The dominant of a set, is that the union of the spaces that you can get by adding non-negative vectors to each of a point in it.
