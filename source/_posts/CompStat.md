Here are my review notes of course Computational Statistics opened by [Dr. Marloes H. Maathuis](https://stat.ethz.ch/~maathuis/), Seminar of Statistics, ETH Zurich, 2019 Spring. The course was amazing with clearly explained theories and matched coding practices. The professor preferred to writing on the blackboard. So I organized my course notes as a PDF file as well as the final exam cheatsheet.
