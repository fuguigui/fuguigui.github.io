# Keywords

- attachment strategy

  - preferential attachment

- master equation

- time-dependent degree distribution

  

# Attachment rules

## Uniform attachment

new nodes form links to existing nodes chosen uniformly at random

### degree distribution

exponentially shaped

e.g. much like those generated by Erdos-Renyi random graph models

## Preferential attachment

new nodes preferentially form links to highly connected nodes. 

### degree distribution

scale-free degree distribution (log-log plot a line)



# Analytical Approaches

Two main tools:

- master equation: for discrete perspective
- continuum limit approximation: for continuous perspective

## Master equation (Rate equation)

### Definition

the first-order differential equations that describe the evolution of probabilities over time.

## Case: uniform attachment

### Settings

- node: each time, add a new node into the system. That is at time t, there are t nodes.
- link: each newly added node uniformly chooses a random existing node. ![img](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?p%3D%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bt%7D)
  - observation: for an existing node, its probability to receive a new link decays over time. 

### Formula

The probability of a node added at time s has the degree k at time t+1

![img](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?p%28k%2Cs%2Ct%2B1%29%3D%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bt%7Dp%28k-1%2Cs%2Ct%29%2B%281-%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bt%7D%29p%28k%2Cs%2Ct%29)

- the first item: the node has degree k-1 at time t

- the second: the node has degree k at time t.

the initial condition

![img](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?p%28k%2C1%2C1%29%3D%5Cdelta_%7Bk%2C0%7D)

- k=0, the value is 1
- otherwise, the value is 0.

the boundary condition

### Degree distribution (time-dependent)

#### Change over time

![img](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?%28t%2B1%29p%28k%2Ct%2B1%29-%28t-1%29p%28k%2Ct-1%29%3Dp%28k-1%2Ct%29%2B%5Cdelta_%7Bk%2C1%7D)

#### limiting value

![img](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?p%28k%29%3D%5Cfrac%7Bp%28k-1%29%2B%5Cdelta_%7Bk%2C1%7D%7D%7B2%7D%3D2%5E%7B-k%7D)

- p(0)=0
- \delta_{1,1}=1
- exponentially-shape degree distribution, **not** like ER networks.
  - because there is a dependence of the average degree on the birth time of a node.

#### Mean degree

how to calculate?

## Case: Preferential attachment

### Settings

- node: each time, add a new node into the system. That is at time t_i, there are i nodes.
- link: each newly added node forms **m** links to existing nodes and the probability to each exsiting node is (**Positive feedback**) ![img](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?p%28v_i%29%3D%5Cfrac%7Bk_i%28t%29%7D%7B%5Csum_jk_j%28t%29%7D) 

### Formula

For each existing node x_i, the expectation of its degree increase  at time t is m\times the probability of one link to it.

Generating to continuous time, we have

![img](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?%5Cfrac%7Bdk_i%28t%29%7D%7Bdt%7D%3Dm%5Ccdot%5Cfrac%7Bk_i%28t%29%7D%7B%5Csum_jk_j%28t%29%3D2mt%7D%3D%5Cfrac%7Bk_i%28t%29%7D%7B2t%7D)

- initial condition: ![img](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?k_i%28t_i%29=m)

We get

![img](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?k_i%28t%29%3Dm%28%5Cfrac%7Bt%7D%7Bt_i%7D%29%5E%7B%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%7D)

- node degrees grow as square root of time
- node degrees are age-dependent.

### Degree distribution

After a series of complex calculation,

![img](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?p%28k%29%3D2m%5E2k%5E%7B-3%7D%5Cpropto k%5E%7B-3%7D)

- degree distribution follows a power-law distribution with parameter 3.

#### Matthew effect

A dynamics by which "the rich get richer" (first-mover advantage). i.e. the degree of those nodes that already have the most links will grow fastest.



# Preferential attachment

## Simple attachment model

limitation: 

- global knowledge. The newly added node needs to have the global knowledge.
- Preferential attachment here is an **observation** not **mechanism**.

## Copying model

This is a local mechanism model. 

A newly  introduced node randomly selects a target node and links to it, as well as to all (some) ancestor nodes of the target node.

## Random walk model

new nodes start random walk at random node and form a link every l steps

- produce different clusters depending on the distance l: small l will lead to higher clustering

## Heterogenous node fitness

## Relation with Scale-free network

Preferential attachment is a **sufficient condition** of scale-free network, **not** a **necessary condition**.

Not all scale-free network are generated by preferential attachment.
