# Questions

- For an undirected network, define the degree distribution and the mean degree.
  - degree distribution: ![img](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?P%28d_i%3Dn%29%3D%5cfrac%7B%7Cd_j%3D n%7C%7D%7BN%7D)
  - mean degree: ![img](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?%5Cbar%7Bd%7D%3D%5Cfrac%7B%5CSigma_%7Bi%7Dd_i%7D%7BN%7D)

- define the degree assortativity coefficient. What do positive and negative values indicate, what does a zero value mean?
- what is a stylised fact? Give an example for a real-world network
- algorithmic formulation for G(n,p)/G(n,m) model
  - G(n,p):
    1. build n nodes
    2. for each node i, iterate on all the other nodes
       1. generate a uniformly distributed random number t between 0 and 1.
       2. if t<p, add an edge between  i and the other node
  - G(n,m) (undirected version):
    1. build n nodes
    2. from (1, 2, ... , n(n-1)/2) randomly choose m different numbers.
    3. link edges between the pairs corresponding to the encoded number.
- what is a statistical ensemble in the context of complex networks? what is macrostate? what is microstate?
- what is the limiting degree distribution for networks generated by the G(n,p) model?
  - In G(n,p) model, a node has degree ![img](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?i) 's probability ![img](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?P%28d_x%3Di%29%3D%5Cfrac%7B%28n-1%29%21%7D%7Bi%21%28n-1-i%29%21%7Dp%5Ei%281-p%29%5E%7Bn-1-i%7D)
  - this is a binomial distribution. I think the limitation of binomial distribution with ![img](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?n%5cto%5cinfty) is a Poisson distribution. No, it is normal distribution.
- Under what condition does the degree distribution converge to a Poisson distribution?
  - inspired by the G(n,p) model: when all the nodes have almost the same degree?
- What degree assortativity coefficient do you expect for a random network?

# Keys

- degree assortativity coefficient,  
- statistical ensemble,

- limiting degree distribution

# Statistical index
## Degree

### Degree sequence

- graphic degree sequence

### Degree distribution

compared to degree sequence: we lose the information of the number of nodes.

- mean degree, can be calculated from degree distribution.

### Degree assortativity coefficient

- assortativity: measure something in common.
- degree assortativity: to what extent the nodes are linked to nodes that are similar.
- Positive value (**assortative mixing**): high-degree nodes are
  preferentially connected to other high-degree nodes and low-degree nodes
  are preferentially connected to other low-degree nodes
- negative value (**disassortative mixing**): high-degree nodes are
  preferentially connected to low-degree nodes and vice-versa
- In social networks, assortative mixing is common.

## Triads

### Transitivity

closed triads

### Clustering coefficient

clustering coefficient can be interpreted as conditional probability, when A and B both link to C, the probability of there is an edge between A and B.

- local clustering coefficient: (the node level)

  is defined by the number of links between its neighbors normalized by the total possible number of links between its neighbors.

  - undirected network: ![img](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?C_i%3D%5Cfrac%7Bk%28i%29%7D%7Bd_i%28d_i-1%29%2F2%7D)

- global clustering coefficient (the network level):

  average through all the nodes

# Stylised facts

summarize results in a rough way, capturing some broad tendencies and ignoring the individual detail.

For example, a network has small clustering coefficient, large diameters, broad/narrow degree distribution, assortative/disassortative.

- We can compare to **random networks** to generate some interesting findings!!!

# Micro-/Macro-scopic Perspective

- when we have full knowledge of a system, it is reasonable to take a microscopic perspective.
- when we want to understand why different systems exhibit similar features, we need to take a macroscopic perspective.

## Statistical ensembles

to deal with **lack of** knowledge about **micro**scopic details.

We use statistical ensembles to find **statistical regularities** of microstates, when given macrostates.

### Random graph models

- using simple stochastic (null) models as the reference study networks
- important **baseline** for network analysis and pattern recoginition
- models:
  - Erdos-Renyi model: G(n,p)/ G(n,m)
    
    - for G(n,m) model, we can calculate:
      
      - the mean of degree: ![img](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?%5Cfrac%7B2m%7D%7Bn%7D)
      - the variance of degree: 
        - there are totally n(n-1)/2 edges
        - the probability of each edge being selected is: 2m/n(n-1)
        - the probability of a node has degree k is: ![img](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?%5Cfrac%7B%28n-1%29%21%7D%7Bk%21%28n-1-k%29%21%7D%5Ccdot%20p%5Ek%281-p%29%5E%7Bn-1-k%7D)
        - the variance is: ![img](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?n%5Ccdot%20%5Cfrac%7B2m%7D%7Bn%28n-1%29%7D%5Ccdot%20%281-%5Cfrac%7B2m%7D%7Bn%28n-1%29%7D%29)
    - for G(n,p) model, we can calculate 
      
      - the probability of one node has degree i
      - the probability of the network has m edges. (these two are binomial distribution)
      - first raw moment: the mean degree: ![img](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?%5Clangle k%5Crangle%3Dnp)
      - second raw moment -> the variance of degrees: ![img](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?Var%28k%29%3D%3Ck%5E2%3E-%3Ck%3E%3Dnp%281-p%29)
      - limiting degree distribution. 
        - Fixed p, For very large network, it approximates to a **normal distribution**, with mean np, variance np(1-p)
        - Fixed np. That is when n goes to infinity, p goes to 0. It approximates to **Poisson distribution**, with  ![img](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?%5Clambda%20%3D%20%3Ck%3E%3Dnp), and ![img](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?P%28k%29%5Csim%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Clambda%5Eke%5E%7B-%5Clambda%7D%7D%7Bk%21%7D)

## Macroscopic 

we usually study a network based on its aggregate statistics. Lose detailed information allows us to imitate more networks sharing the same statistics and study and compare them.

### Examples

Examine the following index of a network

- the number of nodes

- the number of edges

- the mean degree

- the diameter of the network

- the average path length

- the clustering coefficient

- the degree assortativity

- the degree distribution. When the degree distribution is broad and the mean degree is small, it requires more care to interpret the mean degree.
