									<h1>What do I expect<br />
									 for this blog?</h1>
									<p>A brief introduction for the birth of this blog. What could it be? A technical blog? A record of my life? A virtual world for a girl?</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>This blog was birthed at December 28, 2018, in New Jersey, U.S.A. At that time, I was living with my boyfriend, spending my Christmas break. Since I was still busy with the following semester examinations and lack of knowledge of web development, I failed to give it a perfect, satisfying and attractive beginning, which would be this article. Now, I have been back to Switzerland and been free after these exams. It is the time to invent the first article for this blog.</p>
								<p>To be honest, the dream of owning an individual blog has exsited for a long time at the deep of my heart. It feels like having a secret garden, just as the name of this blog, that I can freely save every treasure of my life here, some mood, some wishes or some stories. The garden is open to everybody, whether we are familiar or unfamiliar.  If you can get some value from my blog, I will be really honored. If not, at least, this blog is a record of my life. I could find my life's trace from it with time passing by. I know what I have created, lost, achieved and expected for this world. In this way, it can be viewed as a diary, a more open diary. We are always trying to find some way to prove our existence, right? Let this blog be such a carrier.</p>
								<p>So, what do I expect for this blog? Or, what Information can you get from this blog? There will totally be three parts, both for my public work and for my personal growth.</p>
								<p>The first part is about techniques, what I have learnt in the way of being a data scientiest. In this part, it will be similar to most of the techniqual blogs. I will share what I have learnt in Data Science. Class notes, project codes, other peoples' work will be posted, covering topics like machine learning, big data, etc. After all, this is a github homepage, for which the codes should be the leading role.</p>
								<p>The name of the second part is Stories & Thoughts. This works as the record of my past life. I try to tell stories on what I have experienced, what makes great influences on myself. The topics can be my emotions, my journey, my ideas about a movie, a book, or my thoughts of this world. These stories may be postive or negative, full of hope or depression. What I can guarantee is that there is always something real behind them.</p>
								<p>Finally, the third part is for future, for my daydreams. Who do I hope myself to become? What am I going to do in the following month, year, ten years? People always need to live with dreams, don't we? Who care the fact that at most of the time, we can never fulfill our dreams. This part may be a little boring. I may even post very detailed plans here. If you don't like that, just jump it. I care these dreams/flags, no matter how their result could be. They are my motivations to live.</p>
								<p>Fine, this is what this blog could become, as a record of time, as a proof of growth. Hope it can bring you some value. If you want to say something, feel free to leave a message below. I am looking forward to hearing from you. All the best.</p>
